# DeepLearning.AI & Stanford â€“ Machine Learning Specialization (Coursera) ðŸ§ 

This repository contains my personal lab work from the [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) offered by **DeepLearning.AI** and **Stanford University** on **Coursera**.

> ðŸ”¬ This specialization is a modern update to Andrew Ng's original course, covering supervised learning, advanced algorithms, and unsupervised/reinforcement learning â€“ with hands-on Python labs.
